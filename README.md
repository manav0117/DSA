Introduction
The DSA Folder is a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in different programming languages. Whether you are a beginner learning the basics of DSA or an experienced developer looking for a quick reference, this repository aims to provide you with well-organized and documented code examples.

Data Structures
In the data_structures directory, you will find various implementations of common data structures such as:

Arrays
Linked Lists
Stacks
Queues
Trees
Graphs
Hash Tables
Heaps
and more...
Each data structure is implemented in different programming languages, making it easier for you to grasp the concepts and compare the differences in implementation across languages.

Algorithms
In the algorithms directory, you will find implementations of various algorithms that are commonly used in computer science and software development. Some of the algorithms included are:

Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
Graph Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
Dynamic Programming Algorithms
Greedy Algorithms
and more...
Each algorithm is accompanied by a detailed explanation of its working principle and complexity analysis. We encourage you to explore the code and understand the underlying logic behind each algorithm.
